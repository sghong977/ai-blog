Trying OCR for UI text recognition.


<!--truncate-->



# Goal
- Reason for trying **parseq**: It is state-of-the-art (SOTA).
- The parseq code uses **lmdb**.
- Is it necessary? Investigate other OCR development tools...


# mmOCR

> pip3 install openmim  
> mim install mmcv-full  
> mim install mmdet  
> git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr.git


`python mmocr/utils/ocr.py demo/demo_text_ocr.jpg --print-result --imshow`


After setup, when you input an image, it cuts out the text in a fixed position, recognizes it, and visualizes the result.
Of course, if you run ocr.py, it can also perform detection (localization), but in our case, the format is fixed, so it's better to handle it as a simple cropping preprocessing step.

- Surprisingly, **RobustScanner** and **SAR** work well.
- Naturally, if the text is split into two lines, it fails.
