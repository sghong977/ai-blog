# Issue 1. change scheduler

### Using this
mmclassification doc. [link](https://mmclassification.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/mmcls/core/hook/lr_updater.html#CosineAnnealingCooldownLrUpdaterHook)


### Error
Error Message
> ../aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/Loss.cu:115: operator(): block: [176,0,0], thread: [108,0,0] Assertion \`input_val >= zero && input_val <= one\` failed.

### Debug
Seems like a loss scale issue due to lr, so I re-enabled auto_lr.

Reference: [https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/assertion-input-val-zero-input-val-one-failed/107554/3](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/assertion-input-val-zero-input-val-one-failed/107554/3)


FYI: There is a feature to receive **notifications via email or Slack** in case of crashes or completion of training.

# Issue 2. Ensemble

I investigated and summarized it on my blog: [Link, kor](https://ambitious-posong.tistory.com/201)

The tool provided there takes image inputs, but there is no need to perform inference several times. Therefore, I will receive JSON files and code for ensemble.


Requirements
- Reference Code: [https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Weighted-Boxes-Fusion](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Weighted-Boxes-Fusion)
- output1: /raid/sghong/Detection/mmdetection/work_dirs/yoloxx_0826/inferences/bbox.json
- output2: /nas4/viprior/sbhong/yoloxx/mmcls/submission.json

### Situation
- need to provide only bbox, category id, and score to Weighted-Boxes-Fusion.
- Perform ensemble for each image and save the results (the order should not change due to the submission format).
- Consensus will be added, similar to preprocessing as described in my blog.

Keep using my Docker environment used for running the detection. The only thing I need for these ensemble is:
`pip install ensemble-boxes`.

Implementation
- Using the ensemble-boxes module
- Take multiple JSON inference results as input -> perform ensemble -> then write the results as JSON.
- Follow the 2022 VIPriors Object Detection Challenge submission format.
- Consensus or other preprocessing(?) will be implemented tomorrow....
