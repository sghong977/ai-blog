# Situation
Following the previous issues (refer to the last posts), I have successfully resolved minor data annotation bugs and retrained the image encoder without any more issues. Now, let's bring it back to **mmdetection and train the model**.


### Experiments
- Backbone: CSPDarkNet (initialized with classification training)
- Detection model: YOLOX (one-stage model)
- Weight and Bias logs: [mmdetection](https://wandb.ai/sghong/MMDetection-tutorial?workspace=user-sghong), [mmclassification](https://wandb.ai/sghong/MMcls-challenge?workspace=user-sghong)
- The results will be available in 4 hours, so I will update later.


### Training Settings
List of transfer learning attempts this time:
- YOLOX + CSPDarknet (CE loss)
- YOLOX + CSPDarknet transfer learning
- Cascade RCNN + ResNet50 (CE loss)
- Cascade RCNN + CBNetV2 (CE loss): Currently encountering an error.

### Results?
- **Augmentation**: There was a significant difference between using YOLOXHSVRandomAug or not (mAP difference of 0.1).
- **Weight initialization**: Transfer learning with (supervised) classification task performs better than using self-supervised learning for the backbone. Both settings are better than a general random initialization backbone.
- **Loss**: There was no significant difference between using **CE loss or Label Smooth Loss** during backbone training.
- **Bug**: Encountering nan loss in a specific model while performing mmclassification (ResNet50).



In any case, we achieved a validation mAP of 0.284 in 300 epochs.
Let's try ensemble.
