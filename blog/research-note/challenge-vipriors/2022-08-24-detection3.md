# Situation


Let's improve the detection performance through **transfer learning of the backbone**.
So, I need to switch to mmclassification and train the backbone, but it should be compatible with YOLOX in the existing mmdetection, so I need to train **CSPDarkNet**.


### CSPNet (Cross Stage Partial Network)
- CSPNet enables efficient learning by removing gradient computation redundancy, without modifying the existing architecture.

### Let's train!

Code modification: Since CSPNet exists but the DarkNet version is missing, I copied some code from mmdetection.
- Just the basic version
- Label Smooth
- Multiple losses are not commonly used in classification. Refer to mmcls issue reply. [link](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification/issues/796#issuecomment-1111715069)
- Training results: my mmcls wandb training logs. [log](https://wandb.ai/sghong/MMcls-challenge)
- However, there was an small mistake when converting the data to coco format, so retraining is required...


### Miscellaneous
Joined the detection team in the challenge in a rush, lacking basic skills (this is my first time doing detection).
After the rush is over, I feel that I need to take time to read about the YOLO series...
