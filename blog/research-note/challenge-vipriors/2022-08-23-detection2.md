# Issue 1
Using mmclassification / Creating Object Detection Backbone


### Goal: Improving Object Detection Performance
1. Generate datasets by cropping images using bounding boxes (using roboflow)
2. Train an image classification pretrained model (image encoder) using mmclassification
3. Load the well-trained image encoder and use it for training our detection model


### Tool: mmclassification
To ensure compatibility with our current setting (mmdetection), planning to use mmclassification for training.

# Issue 2
Using Roboflow


### Data Versioning 
- Goal: Pretrain the image encoder to improve performance.
- Approach: Crop images within the bounding boxes and train for classification.
- Method: Go to "Versions" in roboflow -> Select the dataset -> Choose "isolate objects" in preprocessing -> then Dataset is generated!
- Result: A new version of the dataset has been created.
