let's start!

LERF
- LERF can be reconstructed from a hand-held phone capture within 45 minutes
- then can **render dense relevancy maps** **given textual queries** interactively in real-time
- [link](https://www.lerf.io/)
- the immediate output of NeRFs is nothing but a colorful density field, devoid of meaning or context, which inhibits building interfaces for interacting with the resulting 3D scenes
- why natural language
  - handle natural language input queries
  - ability to incorporate semantics at multiple scales and relate to long-tail and abstract concepts


How?
- CLIP without finetuning
- construct a LERF by optimizing a language field jointly with NeRF
  - which takes both position and physical scale as input
  - and outputs a single CLIP vector
  - supervised
  - CLIP embeddings generated from image crops of training views -> multi-scale feature pyramid
