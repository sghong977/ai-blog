Goal of this post is to investigate **Action Detection** datasets such as AVA Action and AVA-Kinetics, as well as the Homage Dataset.

# 내용
1. Explore ActivityNet Challenges
- Conducted initial research to grasp the trends by examining various datasets and tasks related to video understanding.
- findings: I Decided to look into **AVA-Kinetics and Homage**.


By the way, since 2019 that SlowFast won ActivityNet Challenges, Chinese groups have been consistently securing the 1st place in 20, 21, and 22.

- This year (2022) focuses on active speaker detection, which is different due to the use of audio.
- 1st place: [Project Page](https://unicon-asd.github.io/), Code to be released.
- 2nd place by Intel: [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.01479.pdf)


2. About AVA-Kinetics
- Spatio-Temporal Action Localization Task
- Research on state-of-the-art (SOTA): [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/spatio-temporal-action-localization-on-ava), [List of AVA Challenge Winners](http://activity-net.org/challenges/2022/tasks/guest_ava.html)
- "RM" outperformed the ACAR-Net (CVPR 2021 paper) which is a winning model of AVA Action (ActivityNet Challenge 2020)
  - RM: This model won the AVA-Kinetics 2021 Challenge. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08061v2.pdf), but the GitHub code is not available.

3. About Homage

**About Model**
- It seems meaningless to search for SOTA on paperswithcode as there are no notable models reported.
- Official GitHub page provides detailed information about the dataset [github](https://github.com/nishantrai18/homage)
- Let's check the challenge results. [2021 Results](https://homeactiongenome.org/results.html)
- The 2022 results seem unavailable as the challenge ended in June. Challenge Page on [CodaLab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/4264#results)


**About Data**
- Dataset Paper [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05226.pdf)

### My notes...
- [my blog](https://ambitious-posong.tistory.com/121)
- During the survey, I came across this: MIGS (BMVC 2021) [GitHub](https://github.com/migs2021/migs).
  - Although it doesn't use the Homage dataset, it is listed on paperswithcode.
