## [optional] Creating an Organization

Creating an Organization allows accessing it at `https://[organization-name].github.io/`.
You can upload repositories within your organization, but I skipped this step due to laziness.

## Uploading the Code
First, I upload the code that I want to make public.
I created a new repository: [https://github.com/sghong977/Surgical-Bleeding-AMAGI.git](https://github.com/sghong977/Surgical-Bleeding-AMAGI.git)

## Creating a Git Blog  
- Reference: GitHub Pages [link](https://pages.github.com/)
- After creating the repository, I added a template and made modifications in vscode before pushing.
- By installing the Markdown Preview Extension, it's convenient to make edits.
