# Dependencies
- Detectron2
  - python 3.7 >=
  - torch 1.8 >=
- scikit-learn == 0.22
  - it takes a while to set
  - pip: Cython
  - apt-get: gcc, g++
    - [link](https://woowaa.net/entry/gcc-%EC%84%A4%EC%B9%98%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0)
- official neural renderer is tensorflow version.

# Errors
### "ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
`apt-get update && apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6  -y`

### ImportError: ('Unable to load OpenGL library', 'OSMesa: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory', 'OSMesa', None)
- install OSMesa

### AttributeError: 'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'path'
- [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59693174/attributeerror-posixpath-object-has-no-attribute-path)
- [link2](https://ryanking13.github.io/2018/05/22/pathlib.html)
- PosixPath? When I print os.name, 'posix' returned.

# Docker

### How to delete &lt;none&gt; docker images?

`docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)`

After I tried this, every &lt;none&gt; dockers are deleted.

# Installation

### OpenPose
- Install guide [link](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/installation/0_index.md#compiling-and-running-openpose-from-source), [link2](https://jjeamin.github.io/posts/openpose/)
- I'm using Ubuntu server and don't have GUI
- git clone regressively.
- .... I just download openpose docker image. docker pull d0ckaaa/openpose
- cmake ..
- make -j4`nproc`
- how to use: https://viso.ai/deep-learning/openpose/
  
### OSMesa
- Try this. [link](https://pyrender.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/index.html#installmesa)
- Before try this,
  - apt-get install wget
  - apt-get install pkg-config
  - apt-get install libexpat1-dev
- i installed in /usr/local
- MESA_HOME=/usr/local (+/lib?)
- issues
  - https://redstarhong.tistory.com/98 GL? PyOpenGL?
  - update "/opt/conda/lib/python3.9/site-packages/OpenGL/platform/egl.py"
  - apt-get install libosmesa6-dev
  - if PyOpenGL is failed, clone git and reinstall PyOpenGL.
  
### PHALP  
I failed while using conda yml file because:
- First, I installed conda inside of a docker container to keep experiments going on.
  - when I tried to create conda env, it takes more than an hour to solve dependencies, but it still doesn't finished.
- Then, I tried to install every commands on my own, neural renderer and cuda path problems occurred.
  - It was hard for me to find cuda path in conda env because someone said that each conda environment would only contain the parts of cuda
  - So I should export every paths of cuda related stuff, but when I searched cuda paths in my server computer, there are too many other settings, so I'm not sure what to add
- These are the reasons why I didn't use conda

I use these commands sequentially. After that, demo works well on my docker container.
Official PHALP's colab pip output: [phalp_colab.txt](https://github.com/sghong977/sghong977.github.io/files/11175914/phalp_colab.txt)  
  
! pip install pyrender  
! pip install opencv-python  
! pip install joblib  
! pip install cython  
! pip install scikit-learn==0.22  
! pip install scikit-image

! pip install scenedetect[opencv]  
  
But if you use v1.1, additional packages are needed.
- Install OSMesa
- pip install smplx submitit rich pyrootutils colordict
- pip install -e .
- install hydra-core again (Posix error)
- python scripts/demo.py video.source=\'"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEH_5T9jMVU"\'
  - I use osmesa, not egl
