Format doesn\'t matter but the later one is better to keep more information on remain scene\\n- **Issue**\\n  - prefer to use **generalized pretrained model**\\n  - Fully Automatic: without any supervision from human (without GUI prompt)\\n  - speed matters\\n\\n\\n## How?\\n**1. OCR**\\nFirst of all, optical character recognition would be a nice and trustful approach because it has been a long-lasting computer vision task.\\n- **Scene Text Detection (Localization)**: to get bbox area of the text in the image\\n  - e.g., CRAFT [https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch](https://github.com/clovaai/CRAFT-pytorch) provides the pre-trained model\\n- Scene Text Recognition: I don\'t need this part\\n\\n**2. Generalized Segmentation Model**\\nThese days, \\"Segment Anything\\" is a trending topic in the field of computer vision. Therefore, I am examining the performance of SAM in masking text areas, and conducting a survey on follow-up studies.\\n\\n\\n## Step 1. What is SAM?\\nI believe the scene text detection task is well-known and has already achieved satisfactory performance. Therefore, I will explore how SAM works for my specific task.\\n\\n\\n- **Generalization**: SAM is general enough to cover a broad set of use cases and can be used out of the box on new image domains \u2014 whether underwater photos or cell microscopy \u2014 without requiring additional training (a capability often referred to as zero-shot transfer).\\n- **Time Cost**: using light-weight for the real-time inference\\n- **Promptable Segmentation Task**: take various prompts to train for enabling a valid segmentation even with the ambiguous inputs\\n  - e.g., Forground, Backgroud Points / Bounding Box / Masks / Free-form Text are defined as prompts.\\n  - But free-form text is not released (2023.04.06)\\n\\n\\n**How the model looks like:**\\n- To summarize, the model composed of 3 parts. image encoder, prompt encoder, and decoder.\\n- image encoder: MAE (Masked Auto-Encoder), takes 1024x1024 sized input, using pretrained ViT\\n- prompt encoder: the model convert any types of prompt to 256 dim.\\n  - text: using CLIP embedding\\n  - fg/bg or bbox: using 2 points (NN)\\n  - Mask: using CNN to reduce size and the last, 1*1 conv generates 256 dim code\\n![img](https://scontent-gmp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/338558258_1349701259095991_4358060436604292355_n.png?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ad8a9d&_nc_ohc=6YFtfSFN9TkAX9KWrZS&_nc_ht=scontent-gmp1-1.xx&oh=00_AfBir_KH9omTbT4lVU6Gx7XOIQ21vb_ytXcNu9ikPmO8XA&oe=649F0109)\\n\\n\\n**Dataset: SA-1B**\\n- COCO run-length encoding (RLE) annotation format\\n- provides 11M images and the huge amount of class agnostic, only for the research purpose (the mask doesn\'t contains the category!)\\n- masks are autogenerated by SAM\\n- you can request validation set, which is randomly sampled and annotated from human annotators.\\n\\n\\n**My comments:**\\nI need a fully automatic process but finding fg&bg or bbox would be an additional task. Luckly, I find a nice open-source project to tackle this!\\n\\n\\nHowever, Language SAM is not exactly the same as the original SAM architecture, since Language SAM is relying on text-to-bbox approach by combining SAM and GroundingDINO.\\n- [GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO)\\n- [Segment-Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)\\n- GUI is available by [Lightning AI](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning)!

Making Images Real Again: A Comprehensive Survey on Deep Image Composition\\n2. Bag of Freebies for Training Object Detection Neural Networks\\n\\n\\n### Image Composition?\\n- The issue of **small datasets** -> The concept of image composition came up as a way to diversify information through **data augmentation**.\\n- (Refer to Paper 1) It was shared by a team member that image compositing is not about randomly placing objects like simple copy & paste algorithm. Instead, it aims to make the composition **more realistic**.\\n  - For example, human should be not copy&pasted in the sky, since we cannot fly!\\n\\n\\n### Tools\\n- I came across a website called [FiftyOne](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/). It seems to be related to detection bounding boxes and instance segmentation annotation tools. I should take a look at it.\\n- [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/): It provides detailed analysis of the dataset itself, various augmentations, and the ability to train models on the web.\\n  - The visualization is also well-done, making it convenient.\\n  - It seems that training is free for up to 3 times, and an email will be sent when the training is completed.\\n  - I haven\'t used either of them yet, so I\'ll make a note after trying them out.\\n    - -> (UPDATED) I totally fall in love to the Roboflow!\\n\\n\\n### Hyperparameter Tuning?\\n- Refer to **Paper 2**.\\n- (My teammate who keep on this field told me that) It is recommended to **use well-known hyperparameters** as they are, instead of hyperparameter tuning and search.\\n\\n\\n### Small Object, High Bounding Box Overlap Issue\\nWhen training for small objects, a simple method is to increase the resolution.\\nWe had a meeting to analyze the characteristics of the current target data (VIPriors [link](https://vipriors.github.io/), for challenge) through the dataset health check in Roboflow and find possible solutions.\\n\\nThe discussion content, future improvements, and work direction will be added below after the meeting.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Idea? (after meeting)\\n- Train based on their own characteristics: Divide into small, medium, and large categories.\\n  - for example, in the case of bicycle data where there are many overlapping small object bounding boxes, divide them into multiple models, each responsible for a few classes. Then, combine the results during inference.\\n  - It is not an ensemble, simply divide the recognizable classes by several models.\\n- Transfer learning: Pretrained models are not allowed in this challenge. But, instead of random initialization, what if we crop object bounding boxes and **train an image classification model** to **initialize the image encoder**?\\n\\n\\n\\n### etc\\nsurvey on crowd detection..."}]}')}}]);
